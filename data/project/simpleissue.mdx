Surprise! not a product named Doge!!
I have been using [Linear](https://linear.app) for a while now.
Linear is a great solution for software teams to track and
manage issues at a single place. The app is clean and works really
well. Linear helps teams maintain productivity on the top.

So I decided to build a linear clone! Introducing SimpleIssue.
It is just like linear but with fewer features ofcourse. I learnt a
lot of stuff so far and I have tried my best to apply it the best way possible.

## What is an 'issue' in software engineering?

In software engineering, an issue can be defined as a piece of
work that needs to be done. An issue can be a bug, a feature,
or an improvement to the product. A lot of times issues are mismanaged
and not well maintained. To develop high quality products, it is
really important that software teams maintain a good track of
issues.

## What is the tech stack?

Well it is written in my favorite language of course, TypeScript.
I spent a lot of time on designing the database schema which is powered
by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

I used [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) to efficiently
render tables in the Next.JS application.
I'm a great admirer of Tanner Linsley's work on React Packages ecosystem.
The DX, performance and documentation are of amazing quality.
It is a great tool to do tables in react! And trust me, tables
are not fun as they look.

## What did I learn when building this issue tracker?

Tables are important. I learnt how to properly use a table,
map data into the table, learnt to search the table contents and
pipe it through (the search queries ofcourse) Debounce to avoid unneccessary re-renders.

In bigger apps, state management does make sense. I used Zustand
to management the current application state, current issue state
and list of issues. It really works well with TypeScript and the API
is easy to use.

## Some features

So with with SimpleIssue, you can create infinite organizations,
add members to them, and create and manage issues.

Optimistic UI. No more loading spinners, the UI is updated before the
data is even fetched.

You can also comment on issue, change its Priority ("we want it done by friday, and yes your holiday is cancelled").
as well as project status.

All tables are fully paginated, searchable and sortable (pun-intended)

## What is lacking

Well ofcourse, I am missing on a lot of features, but
I am sure you will find them in the future! Stuff like user
issue assignment need email notifications.
A lot of features like team management, project management
can be added to improve this app.

## Try it out!

I have put a lot of efforts into making it as nice as possible.
You can use these credentials to login:

- email: root@simpleissue.com
- password: root_user

## Screenshots for the lazy.

Alright! you can view the screenshots of the app here.
