## Tech Stack Used:

This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I used this project as a way
to learn about GraphQL awesomeness. The backend API is a Apollo-Express GraphQL server.
Both backend and frontend are written in Typescript. The database used is PostgreSQL with Prisma.

For data fetching on the frontend, I used Apollo Client. It supports SSR so that you get awesome
performance, and great SEO! Apollo Client also supports relay style pagination.

I chose tailwindCSS to build the UI. I abstracted atomic components like buttons, inputs.

All image uploads are done through Cloudinary Node.JS SDK. It's a cloud image hosting service.
Cloudinary provides around 25GB storage bandwidth every month.

All queries are written in a GraphQL framework [GiraphQL](https://www.giraphql.com/).
It makes writing GraphQL queries a breeze. GiraphQL works well with Prisma and comes with
out of the box support for stuff like Auth Scopes, Prisma integration and much more.

The relay team at Meta has made a pagination spec that defines data as Nodes and Edges.
A typical GraphQL query looks like this:

```graphql
query {
  allPosts(first: 10, after: "cursor") {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        ... on Post {
          title
          body
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the query, the connection model provides a standard mechanism for slicing and paginating the result set.

In the response, the connection model provides a standard way of providing cursors, and a way of telling the client when more results are available.

## Key Learnings

- Learnt about GraphQL. I was a little confused at first, but I was able to get a good grasp of it.
  Not every page needs complete user data. With GraphQL you can only fetch what you want, you can even
  convert it into reusable fragments. This is a great way to keep your queries clean and readable.

- Used PostgreSQL for the first time. I am personally biased towards using SQL. Data is always connected
  with each other. While I had DBMS subject during my CS Degree studies, being able to use the
  DBMS knowledge and apply it in a real world app was an amazing experience.

## Miscellanous

DogeSocial recieved amazing response from everyone. The launch day saw around 80+ real user signups.
It is one of my projects which took a lot of time to build.
