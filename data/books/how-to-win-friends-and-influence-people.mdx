"How to Win Friends and Influence People" presents principles supported by numerous examples.
The author strongly believes that success revolves on our ability to connect with others effectively, understanding their desires, fears, and motivations.

Some of these principles involve showing genuine interest in others, expressing appreciation, and active listening.
These practices help one develop strong mutual respect and long-lasting relationships.

I particularly enjoyed the section addressing conflict and criticism.

1. Make The Other Person Feel Important - And Do It Sincerely
2. Give Honest, Sincere, Appreciation
3. Become Genuinely Interested In Other People
