We've all dealt with code that forces us to jump between files, docs, or configs to understand it.
It's not a huge problem, but it may slow things downâ€”especially for frequently used code.
In-house icon libraries, methods, or tokens might not always be covered by JSDoc or types,
making them tricky to grasp at a glance.

## 1. The Problem.

Imagine your team is working with an extensive icon library, where developers frequently use icons
across various components. The code might look something like this:

```tsx
<IconAddUser size={16} />
```

It may be hard to immediately know what the `AddUser` icon looks like.
Developers often end up searching the icon library documentation to check the visual appearance of each icon.
This can interrupts the flow, especially when the icon library is large and complex.

## 2. Sometimes, Speed > Details.

What if, instead of leaving the editor to search for the icon's preview, you could just hover over the
icon name and instantly see what it looks like?
With a custom VS Code extension you can:

- Hover over the icon and immediately see what it looks like.
- Move fast by understanding context without leaving the code.

## 3. Identifying Code Worth Documenting.

While custom hover documentation is great, it's important to identify where it will provide the most value.
The primary motivation here is to enrich the development environment with the tools
and features that make life easier for the team.

These are some of the areas that could benefit from custom hover documentation:

- **Visual Aids**: Icon previews, asset previews
- **Domain Specific Knowledge**: Definitions of finance terms, or a glossary of commonly used terms.
- **Theme Tokens**: Color token preview, sizing token preview that may not be realized without seeing the docs.
- **User Roles**: Role-specific configurations, such as a user's permissions or a specific user's settings.

## 4. Writing your first VS Code extension.

### Step 1: Scaffolding a new VS Code extension.

We'll use Yoeman to create a new VS Code extension boilerplate. Run the following command:

```bash
npx --package yo --package generator-code -- yo code
```

Choose the option New Extension (TypeScript) and press enter. Open the file `src/extension.ts`.
and press `F5` to start debugging. This will compile and run the extension in a new VS Code window called
`Extension Development Host`. Now within this new window, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette.
Search for the word `Hello` and select the command `Hello World`. You should see the message `Hello World`
in the bottom right corner of the screen.

### Step 2: Adding your first hover provider.

Let's take an example of the Icon previews. We'll show the icon preview when `<Icon* />` is hovered over.

You can use one of the following strategies to provide icon previews:

- Have your icons hosted somewhere (e.g. in a CDN) that can be accessed by their name. ex. http://your-icon-cdn.com/icon-name.png
- Detect the usage of icon library in your codebase and render the hovered icon within the hover panel using React/Your framework.

For simplicity, we'll go with the first approach. Add the following code to your `src/extensions.ts` file

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

const ICON_REGEX = /<Icon name="(\w+)" \/>/;

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  const hoverProvider = vscode.languages.registerHoverProvider(
    { language: 'typescriptreact', scheme: 'file' },
    {
      provideHover(document, position) {
        const range = document.getWordRangeAtPosition(position, ICON_REGEX);
        if (!range) return;

        const hoveredText = document.getText(range);
        const iconName = hoveredText.match(/name="(\w+)"/)[1];

        const markdown = new vscode.MarkdownString(`
            <img src="https://your-icon-library-url.com/icons/${iconName}.png" width="100" height="100" />
        `);

        markdown.isTrusted = true;

        return new vscode.Hover(markdown, range);
      }
    }
  );

  context.subscriptions.push(hoverProvider);
}
```

Okay, that seems like a lot of code. Let's break it down.

- `vscode.languages.registerHoverProvider`: This is a function that enables a hover provider for a specific language. In our case,
  we've chosen `typescriptreact` which means the hover provider will be available in `*.tsx` files.
- `provideHover`: This is one of the callback functions we pass as the second argument to the `registerHoverProvider` function.
  It lets us access the `document` (the VS Code document object, afterall, VS Code is written in electron), the `position`
  represents a specific location in a text document.
- `context.subscriptions`: This manages the lifecycle of an extension.

You can read more about the `HoverProvider` API [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#HoverProvider)

Now that we have the idea about the API, let's understand what the code is doing.

- We hover over an `<Icon name="add-user" />` usage, we match it with our regex, and get the icon name, `add-user`.
- We then create a `MarkdownString` object, which is a special type of string that can be rendered as HTML.
- We then set the `isTrusted` property to `true` to allow the markdown string to be rendered as HTML. We put the icon link in an `<img />` tag.
- Finally, we return a `Hover` object with the markdown string and the range of the hovered icon.

This will produce a result that'll look like below

  height="522"

/>

How cool!

### Step 3: Publishing on VS Code Marketplace
