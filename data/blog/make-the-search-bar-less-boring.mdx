The core of any search experience is the search bar. It is one of the most prominent things users
notice when they land on the search page. Search bars act as the primary way to convert users, helping them discover what they are looking for.

I love to work with animations, they make the UI pop, enjoyable and delightful to use.
As part of the revamped search experience that we launched recently on the smallcase app, I got to work on the
search bar.

Traditionally speaking, search bars are built with static placeholders.
If your company offers multiple products, showcase them directly in the search bar. This allows users to quickly discover what you offer, enhancing visibility and driving engagement.

We can make our search bar less boring by adding placeholders that animate. In this guide we'll take a look at how we can achieve this without using any third party library; all done with just React Native!

## What will we be building?

<VideoPlayer videoPath="/static/images/make-the-search-bar-less-boring/video3.mov" />

In this guide, we will be building a search bar component that cycles through provided placeholder copies.
Each placeholder that we pass, will be animated from bottom to top. This creates a nice effect of
infinite sliding animation. We will develop it in a way that it can be used anywhere and not just in the search bar!
How cool!

## Tools we need

1. React Native
2. Knowledge of React hooks like useEffect, useRef

## Component breakdown

The search bar is fairly simple, a rectangle with a magnifying glass icon on the left.
Let's go ahead and import the components we need.

```tsx
import { View, StyleSheet, TouchableDebounce, Text } from 'react-native';
import { IconSearch } from '@org/your-icons';
```

```tsx
<TouchableDebounce onPress={(): void => {}} style={styles.container}>
  <View style={styles.innerContainer}>
    <IconSearch color="#81878C" size={16} />
    <Text style={styles.placeholder}>Search for...</Text>
  </View>
</TouchableDebounce>
```

Let's just add some styles to our search button.

```tsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    borderRadius: 8,
    paddingHorizontal: 16,
    paddingVertical: 8,
    marginHorizontal: 8,
  },
  innerContainer: {
    display:'flex',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'center',
    gap: 8
  },
  placeholder: {
    color: '#81878C',
    fontSize: 14,
  }
```

## Animating the text

We'd be using the built in `Animated` library to animate the text sliding in and out. The inbuilt library
provides just enough APIs for us to do this.

Before we start, let's understand the math behind the animation.
We use two animated values,`currentItemY` and `nextItemY`, to control the vertical position of the current and next placeholder. The `currentItemY` starts at 0 while the `nextItemY` starts at the height of the placeholder.

During each animation cycle, the `currentItemY` is animated to move up by a length that is equal to the
height of the placeholder, at the same time, the `nextItemY` is animated to move to 0 - which brings it
into the view!

## The component API

Keeping versatility in mind, we would be implementing the following API for our component.

```ts
type Props = {
  items: Array<React.ReactNode>;
  cycleDuration?: number;
  renderItem: (item: React.ReactNode) => React.ReactNode;
};
```

- `items` - An array of items that will be rendered as placeholders
- `cycleDuration` - The duration of the animation cycle in milliseconds. Defaults to `800`
- `renderItem` - A function that takes in an item and returns a React node. This is used to render the placeholders. It is also versatile enough to enable consumers to render any kind of content.

Let's go ahead and create the component's basics state management

```tsx
const ANIMATION_DELAY = 800;

const ItemCycler = (props: Props): JSX.Element | null => {
  const [height, setHeight] = useState(0);

  const [currentItemIndex, setCurrentItemIndex] = useState(() => height === 0 ? -1 : 0);

  const nextItemIndex = (currentItemIndex + 1) % props.items.length;

  const currentItemY = useRef(new Animated.Value(0));
  const nextItemY = useRef(new Animated.Value(height));
```

We need basic states like the placeholder height and a pointer to the current item in view, tracked by `currentItemIndex`. The `nextItemIndex` is derived from the current index, and we cycle through the items by intersecting it with the total length.

The constant `ANIMATION_DELAY` is set to 800ms. You can tweak it if you want faster/slower animation.

As discussed earlier, we maintain two animated values, `currentItemY` and `nextItemY`.

## Elephant in the room

Translating an amount equivalent to the height of an element is really easy on the web.
But in the realm of React Native, it is not really that straightforward. This is because React Native (at the time of writing)
does not support percentage translates. So, we have to measure the height of the content before attempting to translate it.

We'll use an invisible view to calculate
the height of a placeholder or rather, the item that we are going to render. This height is the core of our
animation logic, it is essentially how we calculate the transforms for the animation.

We'll create an `onLayoutHandler` function, which measures the height of the placeholder
once the component is mounted. We make sure to run this only when height is unavailable as frequent calculation is not required.

```tsx
import { LayoutChangeEvent, useCallback } from 'react';
```

```tsx
const onLayoutHandler = useCallback(
  (e: LayoutChangeEvent): void => {
    if (height === 0) {
      setHeight(e.nativeEvent.layout.height);
    }
  },
  [height]
);
```

Now that we have that setup, we can move to the implementation of the markup.
We'll require a few dependencies.

```tsx
import React, { useRef, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Animated, View, StyleSheet, Text } from 'react-native';
```

```tsx
<View style={styles.mainContainer}>
  <View style={[styles.innerContainer]}>
    <View style={[styles.container, { height }]}>
      {/* The current item */}
      <Animated.View
        style={[
          styles.itemContainer,
          { transform: [{ translateY: currentItemY.current }] }
        ]}
      >
        {props.renderItem(props.items[currentItemIndex])}
      </Animated.View>
      {/* The next item */}
      <Animated.View
        style={[
          styles.itemContainer,
          { transform: [{ translateY: nextItemY.current }] }
        ]}
      >
        {props.renderItem(props.items[nextItemIndex])}
      </Animated.View>
    </View>
  </View>

  {/* Our measure container! */}
  <View onLayout={onLayoutHandler} style={styles.measureContainer}>
    {props.renderItem(props.items[0])}
  </View>
</View>
```

The markup contains two animated views, one for the current item in view and the other for the next item.
Both of these animated views are wired up to their respective transform animated values.
There’s also a measuring container that renders the 1st element of the array, we use it to derive the height of our overall placeholder.

So if you've followed up till now, have a cookie. 🍪 Great job! 😎

Now we move to the next step, which is implementing the animation logic.

## Animation Logic

You see, the animation here really is a sequence of smaller steps.
This sequence goes like this:

1. The current item is animated to move up by the height of the placeholder.
2. We wait for some time, so that the user can read the placeholder.
   and finally,
3. The next item is animated to move up by the height of the placeholder.

Notice how the current element is moved up and at the same time, the next element is brought back into the view.
These animations are running in parallel and so for this, we can use the `Animated.parallel` API. And for sequencing it all together, we can use the `Animated.sequence` API.

We'll start the animation on the mount of the component so for that we'll need the `useEffect` hook.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const animationSequence = Animated.sequence([
    // We wait for the user to be done with the animation
    Animated.delay(props.cycleDuration ?? ANIMATION_DELAY),
    //  Move the current item up
    Animated.parallel([
      Animated.timing(currentItemY.current, {
        toValue: height * -1,
        duration: 500,
        useNativeDriver: true,
        easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.cubic)
      }),
      // Move the next item into the view
      Animated.timing(nextItemY.current, {
        toValue: 0,
        duration: 500,
        useNativeDriver: true,
        easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.cubic)
      })
    ])
  ]);

  // We start the animation only when the height is measured
  if (height > 0) {
    animationSequence.start(() => {
      currentItemY.current.setValue(0);
      nextItemY.current.setValue(height);
      setCurrentItemIndex(nextItemIndex);
    });
  }
}, [height, nextItemIndex, props.cycleDuration]);
```

Notice that we've passed a callback to the `animationSequence.start` method, this callback is called
when the animation is done, but since we want a cycle effect, we just reset the Animated values back to their
defaults and sets the current item index to the next item index. This ensures a seamless cycle.

The easing effect is up to you to tweak, We use `Easing.inOut(Easing.cubic)`. Play around and see what you like!
