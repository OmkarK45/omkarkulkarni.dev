TL;DR - Ever came across the lovely

```jsx
import { Button } from '../../../../ui/Button';
```

pattern?

You can convert this to something like this

```tsx
import { Button } from '~/ui/Button';
```

As your project grows in size, keeping track of imports gets tedious.
Absolute imports are a great way to manage and clean ugly imports.
This can be used with TypeScript as well as JavaScript projects.

# For TypeScript/JavaScript projects

> Add this in the root of the project with the filename tsconfig.json/jsconfig.json

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", ".next"]
}
```

As far as projects bootstrapped with create-react-app is concerned,
a similar setup can be acheived with the help of a npm package
[Craco](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco)

Create a new file craco.config.js and add the following code.
Make sure to follow the jsconfig/tsconfig steps we just saw.

```js:craco.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    alias: {
      '~': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
    },
  },
};

```

I have used in my production projects as well. Really takes pain of calculating
file locations. My mental model around this is, a central place for imports!
So no matter what component requires a button, the import would be always resolved from
'ui' folder.

```jsx
import { Button } from '~/ui/Button';
```

You can also use '@' symbol instead of '~' (tilde) but I find it conflicting it with
npm packages.

Let me know what you think of this setup!
